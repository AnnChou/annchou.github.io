    <!-- 1. Precedent Work: SPOONS -->
  <section id="precedent-work-spoons" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; line-height: 1.6;">
  <h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #333; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">🎬 Precedent Work: SPOONS</h2>
  
  <p>
    <em>SPOONS</em> emerged from a cross-disability screen dance residency, connecting the lived experiences of five artists. 
    <strong>Each of us created our own scene centered around the shared motif of the spoon, reinterpreting it as a symbol of 
      resistance and disability pride.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    In my contribution, I rendered the spoon as hand-folded paper origami. This was a deliberate artistic statement: the
    "spoon"—often seen only as a tool to measure our limitations—is not only something made <em>for</em> us, but also something
    that can be <strong>made <em>by</em> us</strong>. 
    
    This philosophy, first explored with the origami spoon (2023), evolved into the Teapot Lantern series (2026). While the spoon 
    measures energy, the teapot symbolizes the adaptive plasticity of identity, showing how cultural rituals can be remade using 
    the materials at hand in new environments.
  </p>

  <p>This work evolved from the screen into two distinct live solo performances:</p>

  <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <strong>📍 Vine Art Festival (2023):</strong> A daytime outdoor performance featuring live painting. Working within natural light, I used <strong>Tai Chi motions</strong> to sense the energy flow of the spoons through rice paper and "rabbit" banners, which were utilized as tied curtains.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <strong>📍 Vancouver Outsider Arts Festival (2024):</strong> A dark theater performance where I expanded the work into <strong>shadow dance</strong>. I integrated experimental live-object projection to animate the spoons and vases directly onto the banners, creating a layered visual narrative.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In both iterations, movements were memorized arrangements of improvised gestures with intentionality. As an accessibility measure, I articulated the gestures with poetic tone and <strong>audio description</strong>. The set included a fabric banner painted by me years ago featuring a "mother rabbit" with her offspring on a seed-pod boat.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight-note">
    <em>SPOONS</em> directly informs <strong>Eco-Illuminessence</strong> by bringing shadow improvisation, object animation, and accessible, non-verbal storytelling into the heart of the installation-performance.

    <h2>📸 Eco-Illuminessence: A Living Work in Progress</h2>
    <p><em>Eco-Illuminessence: A Sensory Crossing</em> is a cross-disciplinary body of work developed between 2024 and 2025, marking the artist’s first foray into performance. Rooted in her visual installation practice, this evolving series bridges sculptural form and live gesture—inviting audiences into a world of <strong>low-tech enchantment and quiet storytelling through light, shadow, and movement</strong>.</p>
    <p>Presented through <strong>two in-person showings</strong> and <strong>three livestreamed sessions</strong>—including a hybrid event at <strong>Xchanges Gallery</strong> (Victoria, BC)—this early iteration served as both a public offering and a developmental sketch. It became a space of experimentation, reflection, and transformation.</p>

 <!-- 2. Eco-Illuminessence: The Visual & Sensory Core -->
 <section>
      <h2>🌘 The Visual & Sensory Core</h2>
      <p>This immersive project combines traditional <strong>sumi-e paintings</strong>, animal-shaped <strong>lanterns</strong>, <strong>upcycled garden waste</strong> objects, and semi-translucent fabric sculptures. It invites participants to explore light, shadow, and tactile elements in a layered sensory crossing.</p>
      <p>The <strong>sumi-e curtain</strong> is composed of ~70 clear 11x14 pockets, each holding A4 rice paper ink sketches created during the COVID lockdown via virtual plein-air challenges and later on-location plein-air painting. Visitors are encouraged to interact with the curtain and lanterns using light and objects from a <strong>participant experience station</strong> (glass, bamboo sticks, patterned objects, mesh).</p>
  </section>

    <!-- 3. Lanterns & Eco-Art Approach -->
  <section>
      <h2>🦋 Lanterns & Eco-Art Approach</h2>
      <p> The lanterns are <strong>semi-hard sculptures</strong> and stage characters;
        their shadows perform alongside the artist. Eco-materials adapt to West Coast wet weather: 
        rosemary branches, later reinforced with wire, and lavender stems adorn daytime sculptures. 
        Lanterns, props, and the Sumi-e curtain all participate in <strong>interactive improvisation</strong>
        —no rehearsal, experiments with light, position, and shadow gesture determine the performance path.</p>
      <p>This approach prioritizes sustainability, accessibility, and ecological imagination—turning found, upcycled, or natural materials into poetic visual and performative objects.</p>
      <p>This practice evolved in 2026 with the <strong>Teapot Lantern</strong> series, first showcased in the <em>Plasticity</em> exhibition at Habit Coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
      The teapot symbolizes cross-cultural exchange and comfort, while also reflecting the <strong>adaptive plasticity of identity</strong>. By transforming everyday disposable materials—such as Starbucks cups and grocery mesh—into ritual vessels, the work demonstrates how consumer waste can be reshaped into luminous, tactile forms.
      </p>
      <p>
    In both the 2025 installation and the 2026 teapots, these sculptures act as stage characters, with their shadows performing alongside the artist. 
    Whether responding to theatrical projections or the sideways light of a local café, the objects engage in <strong>interactive improvisation</strong>, where shadows and light collaboratively guide the narrative.
      </p>
   </section>

     <!-- 4. Performative Layer< -->
<section>
  <h2>✦ A Sensory Crossing: The Performative Layer</h2>
  <p>
    The performative layer of <em>Eco-Illuminessence</em> was developed in situ through a series of 
    improvisations, using the lantern installation as the stage and the lantern characters as social
    beings. This process emerged after the first week of exhibition, as the artist explored and 
    responded to the gallery’s light conditions, the challenges of managing darkness, and the interplay of 
    handheld lights, sunset illumination, disco light and projections from a book camera.
  </p>
  <p>
    In performance, the fabric lantern sculptures became living puppet-characters—animated not 
    through conventional puppetry, but through <strong>light manipulation, shadow play, and direct interaction</strong>. 
    Handheld lights and live cameras allowed the artist to mobilize shadows, transforming static forms into dynamic silhouettes.
  </p>
  <p>
    A live camera pointed at a flat, illuminated surface enabled direct sumi-e painting. This surface functioned simultaneously 
    as a projection canvas and performance stage. The live feed was projected onto surrounding surfaces, creating a layered visual field. 
    Participants were invited to co-create moments through movement, layering, and manipulation of light.
  </p>
  <p>
    This improvisational layer—<strong>a sensory crossing</strong>—allowed the visual art to speak back poetically through gesture and ephemeral
    choreography. It marked a turning point in the artist’s practice: a conversation between stillness and motion, installation and performance, object and presence.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- 5. Parallel Pathway: Lantern Travelers — Neuro-Sensing Voyage Crossing -->
<section>
  <h2>✦ Parallel Pathway: Lantern Travelers — Neuro-Sensing Voyage Crossing</h2>
  <p>
    A parallel component of <em>Eco-Illuminessence</em> explored a <strong>poly-sensory, neurodivergent creative process</strong> as modular lanterns 
    traveled through urban 
    and natural landscapes. This journey was presented to exhibition audiences as a <strong>photo documentation</strong>, capturing encounters 
    <strong>before, during, and after the exhibition</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Neuro-sensing is an integral part of my creative process. Therefore, all lanterns are made lightweight and modular—designed 
    to be easily disassembled and reassembled on-site. They traveled via buses, ferries, and public spaces, functioning as both 
    invited and uninvited guests of festivals, forming part of my photo-making journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    I actively engage with the lanterns, integrating them into the environment. For example, the dragon hat lantern interacts 
    with urban geometry, climbing racks, gate stoppers, lines of Garry oak branches, lifeguard boats, and the varied habitats 
    along Ambleside Beach (West Vancouver). Water bodies, such as ponds at Governor’s House, provide reflective surfaces that 
    reveal new forms, while nighttime photos capture landmarks like Science World mirrored on puddles.
  </p>

<!-- 6. Component 4: From Ink to Lantern — 2D-to-3D Sumi-e Transformation -->
<section>
  <h2>✦ Component 4: From Ink to Lantern — 2D-to-3D Sumi-e Transformation</h2>
  <p>
    As the fourth major component presented during the <em>Eco-Illuminessence</em> exhibition, this piece complemented the traveling lanterns, in-gallery lantern installations, resilient backlit sumi-e curtain, and participant station. It explored the cyclical process of moving between visual installation and performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Small elements, like the ink-brush bird puppet, illustrate this interplay. In transitioning from 2D form to 3D form, and from visual art to performative practice, I asked: 
    <em>What if a sumi-e brushstroke could become a sculptural form?</em> 
    <em>What if a shadow could be folded into a lantern?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    This inquiry inspired a new direction: transforming 2D sumi-e ink gestures into 3D lantern structures. Brushstrokes once confined to paper were reimagined as translucent forms—curved, stitched, and suspended. The sumi-e curtain became not just a projection surface, but a sculptural archive of movement and memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    This bi-directional crossing—between drawing and object, between shadow and form—continues to shape the evolving language of visual poetics in my practice, connecting improvisation, installation, and audience engagement.

    <!-- Session 2 full excerpt -->
  <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">📺 Session 2: Rough Cut Excerpt</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> Eco-Illuminessence is an access-led performance-installation using animal-shaped lanterns, shifting light, shadow, and silence to create non-verbal and spoken narrative experiences. Structured as a visual poem, it unfolds through movement, image, and sensory cues, connected by rhythm, spatial relationships, and audience presence rather than fixed spoken language.</p>
  
  <p>This video excerpt is a rough edit from Session 2, Camera 1 of 3, showing several key components. The clip begins with live painting on sumi-e paper, projected onto the wall. Using multiple light sources—including a book projector and rainbow/sunset lighting—the artist manipulates brush ink and objects, transforming marks into rain over an umbrella. Staged elements include the rabbit mother with umbrella, paddle, Feminist Dragon Boat, bird, whale, bamboo with leaves, and two mini curtain stands, demonstrating how shadows animate lantern characters.</p>
  
  <p><em>Access note:</em> This clip includes improvised speech without captions. Dual-language captioning and other accessibility strategies were developed and tested in later performances, as part of the ongoing research trajectory. The ideas for captioning, reverse captioning tools, and Draw-Aloud Symptom/s (DAS) integration emerged after this performance and remain in development. The artist aims to prototype and gather feedback during the residency. Some elements—such as merging DAS with lantern-based social characters—are exploratory and may extend beyond the six-week residency to allow for iterative development.</p>

 <!-- 9. Next Step -->
<section>
  <h2>✦ Next Step: Returning to Non-Verbal Roots with Sound Fluidity</h2>
  <p>
    While briefly exploring audio effects, spoken word, and live music, the process reaffirmed a commitment to 
    <strong>non-verbal, sensory-rooted expression</strong>. As a hard-of-hearing artist, I focus on <strong>visual poetics,
      tactile interaction, and embodied storytelling</strong>, creating work that is accessible without reliance on language or sound.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2026, I continue experimenting with shifting light to animate stationary forms, letting narrative emerge through shadow, 
    texture, and vibration. In <em>Eco-Illuminessence</em>, visuals carry the story, while live, improvised English—delivered
    with a d/Deaf accent—can be difficult for audiences to follow in motion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to the finale performance on June 21, I prototyped web-based buttons and physical “pop-cards” to explore reverse captioning, 
    making spoken English an optional, participant-led layer over visual and tactile meaning. Material and energy constraints limited
    full realization, but this remains a key area for development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Post-production raised another challenge: translating English captions into Hong Kong-style Cantonese while preserving playfulness
    and cultural nuance, exemplified by a story of water exploration with my parents. Where possible, I hope to co-develop dual-language 
    captions as an artistic, rather than corrective, choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alongside lantern-based performance, my ongoing Draw-Aloud Symptom (DAS) protocol—a “visual wandering” of past, present, and imagined 
    narratives—explores how participants’ visual timelines merge with lantern characters to deepen agency. 
    
  </p>
  <p>
    My overarching goal is to create spaces where meaning emerges through vibration, touch, and pictorial literacy, making spoken language
    one layer among many. I aim to pause “masking,” follow natural rhythms, and co-learn how multisensory, participant-led strategies 
    expand accessibility and shared understanding.
