    <!-- 1. Precedent Work: SPOONS -->
  <section id="precedent-work-spoons" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; line-height: 1.6;">
  <h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #333; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">🎬 Precedent Work: SPOONS</h2>
  
  <p>
    <em>SPOONS</em> emerged from a cross-disability screen dance residency, connecting the lived experiences of five artists. 
    <strong>Each of us created our own scene centered around the shared motif of the spoon, reinterpreting it as a symbol of resistance and disability pride.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    In my contribution, I rendered the spoon as hand-folded paper origami. This was a deliberate artistic statement: the "spoon"—often seen only as a tool to measure our limitations—is not only something made <em>for</em> us, but also something that can be <strong>made <em>by</em> us</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>This work evolved from the screen into two distinct live solo performances:</p>

  <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <strong>📍 Vine Art Festival (2023):</strong> A daytime outdoor performance featuring live painting. Working within natural light, I used <strong>Tai Chi motions</strong> to sense the energy flow of the spoons through rice paper and "rabbit" banners, which were utilized as tied curtains.
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <strong>📍 Vancouver Outsider Arts Festival (2024):</strong> A dark theater performance where I expanded the work into <strong>shadow dance</strong>. I integrated experimental live-object projection to animate the spoons and vases directly onto the banners, creating a layered visual narrative.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In both iterations, movements were memorized arrangements of improvised gestures with intentionality. As an accessibility measure, I articulated the gestures with poetic tone and <strong>audio description</strong>. The set included a fabric banner painted by me years ago featuring a "mother rabbit" with her offspring on a seed-pod boat.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight-note">
    <em>SPOONS</em> directly informs <strong>Eco-Illuminessence</strong> by bringing shadow improvisation, object animation, and accessible, non-verbal storytelling into the heart of the installation-performance.

    <h2>📸 A Living Work in Progress</h2>
    <p><em>Eco-Illuminessence: A Sensory Crossing</em> is a cross-disciplinary body of work developed between 2024 and 2025, marking the artist’s first foray into performance. Rooted in her visual installation practice, this evolving series bridges sculptural form and live gesture—inviting audiences into a world of <strong>low-tech enchantment and quiet storytelling through light, shadow, and movement</strong>.</p>
    <p>Presented through <strong>two in-person showings</strong> and <strong>three livestreamed sessions</strong>—including a hybrid event at <strong>Xchanges Gallery</strong> (Victoria, BC)—this early iteration served as both a public offering and a developmental sketch. It became a space of experimentation, reflection, and transformation.</p>

 <!-- 2. Eco-Illuminessence: The Visual & Sensory Core -->
 <section>
      <h2>🌘 Eco-Illuminessence: The Visual & Sensory Core</h2>
      <p>This immersive project combines traditional <strong>sumi-e paintings</strong>, animal-shaped <strong>lanterns</strong>, <strong>upcycled garden waste</strong> objects, and semi-translucent fabric sculptures. It invites participants to explore light, shadow, and tactile elements in a layered sensory crossing.</p>
      <p>The <strong>sumi-e curtain</strong> is composed of ~70 clear 11x14 pockets, each holding A4 rice paper ink sketches created during the COVID lockdown via virtual plein-air challenges and later on-location plein-air painting. Visitors are encouraged to interact with the curtain and lanterns using light and objects from a <strong>participant experience station</strong> (glass, bamboo sticks, patterned objects, mesh).</p>
  </section>

    <!-- 3. Lanterns & Eco-Art Approach -->
  <section>
      <h2>🦋 Lanterns & Eco-Art Approach</h2>
        The lanterns are <strong>semi-hard sculptures</strong> and stage characters; their shadows perform alongside the artist. Eco-materials adapt to West Coast wet weather: rosemary branches, later reinforced with wire, and lavender stems adorn daytime sculptures. Lanterns, props, and the Sumi-e curtain all participate in <strong>interactive improvisation</strong>—no rehearsal, experiments with light, position, and shadow gesture determine the performance path.</p>
      <p>This approach prioritizes sustainability, accessibility, and ecological imagination—turning found, upcycled, or natural materials into poetic visual and performative objects.</p>
   </section>

     <!-- 4. Performative Layer< -->
<section>
  <h2>✦ A Sensory Crossing: The Performative Layer</h2>
  <p>
    The performative layer of <em>Eco-Illuminessence</em> was developed in situ through a series of 
    improvisations, using the lantern installation as the stage and the lantern characters as social
    beings. This process emerged after the first week of exhibition, as the artist explored and 
    responded to the gallery’s light conditions, the challenges of managing darkness, and the interplay of 
    handheld lights, sunset illumination, disco light and projections from a book camera.
  </p>
  <p>
    In performance, the fabric lantern sculptures became living puppet-characters—animated not 
    through conventional puppetry, but through <strong>light manipulation, shadow play, and direct interaction</strong>. 
    Handheld lights and live cameras allowed the artist to mobilize shadows, transforming static forms into dynamic silhouettes.
  </p>
  <p>
    A live camera pointed at a flat, illuminated surface enabled direct sumi-e painting. This surface functioned simultaneously 
    as a projection canvas and performance stage. The live feed was projected onto surrounding surfaces, creating a layered visual field. 
    Participants were invited to co-create moments through movement, layering, and manipulation of light.
  </p>
  <p>
    This improvisational layer—<strong>a sensory crossing</strong>—allowed the visual art to speak back poetically through gesture and ephemeral
    choreography. It marked a turning point in the artist’s practice: a conversation between stillness and motion, installation and performance, object and presence.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- 5. Parallel Pathway: Lantern Travelers — Neuro-Sensing Voyage Crossing -->
<section>
  <h2>✦ Parallel Pathway: Lantern Travelers — Neuro-Sensing Voyage Crossing</h2>
  <p>
    A parallel component of <em>Eco-Illuminessence</em> explored a <strong>poly-sensory, neurodivergent creative process</strong> as modular lanterns 
    traveled through urban 
    and natural landscapes. This journey was presented to exhibition audiences as a <strong>photo documentation</strong>, capturing encounters 
    <strong>before, during, and after the exhibition</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Neuro-sensing is an integral part of my creative process. Therefore, all lanterns are made lightweight and modular—designed 
    to be easily disassembled and reassembled on-site. They traveled via buses, ferries, and public spaces, functioning as both 
    invited and uninvited guests of festivals, forming part of my photo-making journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    I actively engage with the lanterns, integrating them into the environment. For example, the dragon hat lantern interacts 
    with urban geometry, climbing racks, gate stoppers, lines of Garry oak branches, lifeguard boats, and the varied habitats 
    along Ambleside Beach (West Vancouver). Water bodies, such as ponds at Governor’s House, provide reflective surfaces that 
    reveal new forms, while nighttime photos capture landmarks like Science World mirrored on puddles.
  </p>

    <!-- Session 2 full excerpt -->
  <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">📺 Session 2: Rough Cut Excerpt</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> Eco-Illuminessence is an access-led performance-installation using animal-shaped lanterns, shifting light, shadow, and silence to create non-verbal and spoken narrative experiences. Structured as a visual poem, it unfolds through movement, image, and sensory cues, connected by rhythm, spatial relationships, and audience presence rather than fixed spoken language.</p>
  
  <p>This video excerpt is a rough edit from Session 2, Camera 1 of 3, showing several key components. The clip begins with live painting on sumi-e paper, projected onto the wall. Using multiple light sources—including a book projector and rainbow/sunset lighting—the artist manipulates brush ink and objects, transforming marks into rain over an umbrella. Staged elements include the rabbit mother with umbrella, paddle, Feminist Dragon Boat, bird, whale, bamboo with leaves, and two mini curtain stands, demonstrating how shadows animate lantern characters.</p>
  
  <p><em>Access note:</em> This clip includes improvised speech without captions. Dual-language captioning and other accessibility strategies were developed and tested in later performances, as part of the ongoing research trajectory. The ideas for captioning, reverse captioning tools, and Draw-Aloud Symptom/s (DAS) integration emerged after this performance and remain in development. The artist aims to prototype and gather feedback during the residency. Some elements—such as merging DAS with lantern-based social characters—are exploratory and may extend beyond the six-week residency to allow for iterative development.</p>
 
</section>

  <section>
    <h2>✦ From Ink to Lantern: 2D-to-3D Sumi-e Transformation</h2>
    <p>As the performance practice deepened, the artist began to ask: <em>What if a sumi-e brushstroke could become a sculptural form?</em> <em>What if a shadow could be folded into a lantern?</em></p>
    <p>This question sparked a new direction in the work: transforming 2D sumi-e ink gestures into 3D lantern structures. Brushstrokes once confined to paper were reimagined as translucent forms—curved, stitched, and suspended. The sumi-e curtain became not just a projection surface, but a sculptural archive of movement and memory.</p>
    <p>This bi-directional crossing—between drawing and object, between shadow and form—continues to shape the artist’s evolving language of visual poetics.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>✦ Returning to Non-Verbal Roots</h2>
    <p>While the artist briefly explored audio effects, spoken word, and live music performance during this phase, the process ultimately reaffirmed her commitment to <strong>non-verbal, sensory-rooted expression</strong>. As a hard-of-hearing artist, she chose to center <strong>visual poetics, tactile interaction, and embodied storytelling</strong> in the next cycle of development—creating work that is accessible without language or sound.</p>
