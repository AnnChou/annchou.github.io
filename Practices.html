      <ul>
        <li>I make lanterns out of fabric, paper, light, vines, and plastic.</li>
        <li>I paint with black ink on translucent surfaces (called sumi-e).</li>

        <li>I perform without speaking—using movement, light, and shadow.</li>

	<!--	old as bio.html
      <p>My creative path began in microscopy photography during my early studies in Medical Laboratory Science—capturing intimate, unseen landscapes of life. As I worked in healthcare and informatics, I continued to explore photography, pottery, and community festival arts, discovering the expressive potential of light and texture.</p>
      <p>Eventually, lantern-building became my medium: an accessible, communal, and sensory-rich language that could travel across both public spaces and diverse bodies. It led me toward installation, projection, puppetry, and ink brushwork—always guided by a respect for materials and the wisdom of lived experience.</p>

      <p>Annreflection Studio is where material meets meaning. I create multisensory works from upcycled paper, garden clippings, clear plastics, mesh, fabric, and vines—making space for stories beyond words. My work honors fragmentation and transformation: I believe materials, like people, can be broken and reformed in ways that carry light.</p>
      <p>Each lantern, shadow-stage, or brush painting is an invitation—to pause, to reflect, to adapt. Whether in storefront windows or woodland trails, I design with mobility, texture, and tenderness in mind.</p>

    <h2>Art × Technology as Ethnography</h2>

    <section id="ethnography-dialogue">
        <h2>Art × Technology as Ethnography and Dialogue</h2>
	<p>Over more than 15 years working in hospitals and digital health, I’ve applied data visualization, ethnographic methods, and participatory co-design to digitally mediated care. I often met people in their everyday environments and brought a sense of critical hope into the design of personal health records—encouraging patients to express their experiences in ways that felt natural and meaningful to them.
	<p>In one co-design project exploring personal health records and agency, we discovered that even technologies carry personas. These tools revealed themselves not as neutral or mundane interfaces, but as expressive, symbolic beings—like butterflies, bats, dogs, and altars. These metaphors surfaced the emotional and cultural dimensions of care technologies, and they continue to shape how I design lanterns, workshops, and interactive experiences today.
	<p>As a <b>hard-of-hearing, neurodivergent artist-scientist and access designer</b>, I often rely on <b>non-verbal, visual-spatial modes of reflection</b>. My practice embraces alternative forms of communication—through light, movement, texture, and metaphor—to create spaces where data, care, and creativity can coexist. Whether in a clinical setting or a public art installation, I see each project as a dialogue: between systems and stories, between structure and softness.   
    </section>

    <h2>Technology Is Never Neutral</h2>
    <p>I view paper and light as “slow technologies” that invite care rather than control. My research at SFU explores how technology reflects how we imagine together.</p>


	<!--
    <section id="technology-philosophy">
	<h2>Technology Is Never Neutral</h2>
	<p>My work explores not just how we use technology—but what technology is. At SFU, I studied its nature as both tool and relationship: shaped by values, pace, and purpose. I see paper, fabric, and light as “slow technologies” that invite care, not control. Through participatory co-design, multisensory methods, and storytelling, I design for relational access and shared meaning—whether in health systems or public art. Technology is never neutral; it reflects how we live, feel, and imagine together.</p>
