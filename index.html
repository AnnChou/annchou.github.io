      <h2>About Ann</h2>
     <p>Ann K. Chou (she/her) is a hard-of-hearing, neurodivergent multi-sensory artist, access designer, artist-scientist, born in Hong Kong and currently active on the unceded lands of the lək̓ʷəŋən and xʷməθkʷəy̓əm peoples—also known as Victoria and Vancouver, BC.</p>
     <p>Her practice bridges science and art—from microscope imaging to lantern-building—working with light, shadow, recycled materials, and movement to explore access, ecology, and collective care. Ann celebrates broken objects, spontaneous collaboration, and joyful inclusion through tactile installations, sumi-e brushwork, and mobile lantern sculptures.</p>

     <p><strong>She believes things are meant to break—and be beautifully rebuilt.</strong></p>
     <p>Her materials often include translucent fabrics, bamboo, garden clippings, mesh, and upcycled plastics, designed for multisensory engagement and adaptability across diverse environments.</p>

      <p>    <i>Critical Ethnographic Design of Participant Personal Health Records for Patient Agency" </i></h2>

          <h3>🎯 Method & Intent</h3>
          <p>This Master's Thesis project (2020-2023) reimagines electronic health records (EHRs) as shared spaces—not just clinical data, but co-authored stories. It centers patient agency and embodied knowledge beyond lab results.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> Critical ethnography + illustrated dialogue + community engaged research</li>
            <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Drawing kits, <em>Draw-Aloud Protocol</em>, ELITO sticky-note mapping</li>
            <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Patient-centred Data Story, agency, design justice, inclusive infrastructure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          This work is part of my Master’s thesis in EHR Design Research within the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University (SFU).

        <!-- Panel 2: Draw-Aloud Protocol in Action -->
        <div class="project">
          <h3>🖌️ Draw-Aloud Protocol in Action</h3>
          <p>
            In familiar, community-based settings, participants mapped their health journeys across three time landmarks—<strong>past</strong>, <strong>present</strong>, and <strong>future</strong>—through live sketching and spoken reflection. These visual timelines became expressive, multimodal health records.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Draw-Aloud protocol is a <strong>guided procedure</strong> designed to support emotional safety and narrative expression. It was facilitated either <strong>live in person</strong> or <strong>via virtual platforms</strong>. A self-directed version was also developed as a <strong>photo-mailback kit</strong>, enabling participants to engage independently while following a structured, reflective flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each session or kit began with a grounding exercise to honor the emotional vulnerability of illness storytelling. To support interpretability by future healthcare providers, we adopted a <strong>“Patient Explanation Model”</strong>, allowing participants to annotate their drawings with short descriptions or keywords in their own words.
          </p>

       </div>
    
        <!-- Panel 3: Personas & Design Impact -->
        <div class="project">
          <h3>🔎 Agentic Technology Personas & Design Impact</h3>
          <p>
            Technology is often framed as a neutral tool—but this project challenges that notion. Through iterative analysis-to-design loops using the ELITO method, we surfaced four <strong>agentic technology personas</strong> that reflect how people relate to health data not just functionally, but emotionally, symbolically, and ritually.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>🦇 <strong>Bat</strong> – Sonification, distance from metrics</li>
            <li>🐕 <strong>Dog</strong> – Ownership, portability</li>
            <li>🛕 <strong>Health Altar</strong> – Ritual, self-body scale</li>
            <li>🦋 <strong>Butterfly</strong> – Hope, visualization</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          <p>
            These metaphors move beyond the idea of technology as a passive or purely clinical interface. They now guide inclusive service design and Draw-Aloud–based workshops, helping teams imagine future systems that are relational, multimodal, and grounded in lived experience.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Multimodal reflection</li>
            <li>Inclusive infrastructure</li>

        Using the ELITO method, participant insights were translated into four technology personas—Bat, Dog, Health Altar, and Butterfly—each representing a unique relationship to health data and care. These personas now inform future blueprints and inclusive service design workshops.
