    <section id="artistic-journey">
      <h2>From Microscope to Lantern Light</h2>
      <p>My artistic path began in microscopy photography during my early studies in Medical Laboratory Science‚Äîcapturing intimate, unseen landscapes of life. As I worked in healthcare and informatics, I continued to explore photography, pottery, and community festival arts, discovering the expressive potential of light and texture.</p>
      <p>Eventually, lantern-building became my medium: an accessible, communal, and sensory-rich language that could travel across both public spaces and diverse bodies. It led me toward installation, projection, puppetry, and ink brushwork‚Äîalways guided by a respect for materials and the wisdom of lived experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="annreflection">
      <h2>Annreflection: A Practice of Listening and Illumination</h2>
      <p>Annreflection is where material meets meaning. I create multisensory works from upcycled paper, garden clippings, clear plastics, mesh, fabric, and vines‚Äîmaking space for stories beyond words. My work honors fragmentation and transformation: I believe materials, like people, can be broken and reformed in ways that carry light.</p>
      <p>Each lantern, shadow-stage, or brush painting is an invitation‚Äîto pause, to reflect, to adapt. Whether in storefront windows or woodland trails, I design with mobility, texture, and tenderness in mind.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="access-statement">
      <h2>Accessibility as Creative Foundation</h2>
      <p>As a Deaf and neurodivergent artist, I prioritize design for inclusion, not afterthought. My performances are often non-verbal. My exhibitions and workshops welcome alternative pacing, communication, and sensory experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visually expressive, low-audio formats</li>
        <li>Light, texture, projection, and scent for multi-sensory access</li>
        <li>Flexible, mobile works that adapt to space and weather</li>
        <li>Hands-on workshops with clear visual guidance and tactile materials</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="mission-driven">
      <h2>Let‚Äôs Collaborate to Build Access and Meaning</h2>
      <p>I welcome commissions, storefront activations, and cross-sector collaborations at the intersection of art, accessibility, and community care. With a background in healthcare and inclusive design, I bring a systems-informed approach to lantern-based artmaking that is adaptable, participatory, and environmentally responsive. I invite partners across cultural, civic, and access-related sectors to help shape multisensory public experiences that are both artistically resonant and socially meaningful.</p>

      <p>Hello! I‚Äôm Ann. I‚Äôm a Deaf and neurodivergent artist living in Victoria, BC.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I make lanterns out of paper, light, vines, and plastic.</li>

        <li>I build puppets and small stages using boxes and recycled materials.</li>
