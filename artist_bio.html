      <h1>About Me -  Ann K. Chou</h1>
      <h2>(she/her) Artist, Access Designer, and Artist-Scientist</h2>
     <p>I am a hard-of-hearing, neurodivergent, Hong Kong‚Äìborn artist and access designer, currently active on the unceded lands of the l…ôkÃß ó…ô≈ã…ôn (Songhees and Esquimalt) and x ãm…ôŒ∏k ã…ôÃì…õm (Musqueam) peoples‚Äîalso known as Victoria and Vancouver, BC.</p>

    <section id="artistic-journey">
      <h2>From Microscope to Lantern Light</h2>
      <p>My creative path began in microscopy photography during my early studies in Medical Laboratory Science‚Äîcapturing intimate, unseen landscapes of life. As I worked in healthcare and informatics, I continued to explore photography, pottery, and community festival arts, discovering the expressive potential of light and texture.</p>
      <p>Eventually, lantern-building became my medium: an accessible, communal, and sensory-rich language that could travel across both public spaces and diverse bodies. It led me toward installation, projection, puppetry, and ink brushwork‚Äîalways guided by a respect for materials and the wisdom of lived experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="annreflection">
      <h2>Annreflection: A Practice of Listening and Illumination</h2>
      <p>Annreflection is where material meets meaning. I create multisensory works from upcycled paper, garden clippings, clear plastics, mesh, fabric, and vines‚Äîmaking space for stories beyond words. My work honors fragmentation and transformation: I believe materials, like people, can be broken and reformed in ways that carry light.</p>
      <p>Each lantern, shadow-stage, or brush painting is an invitation‚Äîto pause, to reflect, to adapt. Whether in storefront windows or woodland trails, I design with mobility, texture, and tenderness in mind.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="access-statement">
      <h2>Accessibility as Creative Foundation</h2>
      <p>As a deaf and neurodivergent artist, I prioritize design for inclusion, not afterthought. My performances are often non-verbal. My exhibitions and workshops welcome alternative pacing, communication, and sensory experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visually expressive, low-audio formats</li>
        <li>Light, texture, projection, and scent for multi-sensory access</li>
        <li>Flexible, mobile works that adapt to space and weather</li>
        <li>Hands-on workshops with clear visual guidance and tactile materials</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ethnography-dialogue">
        <h2>Art √ó Technology as Ethnography and Dialogue</h2>
	<p>Over more than 15 years working in hospitals and digital health, I‚Äôve applied data visualization, ethnographic methods, and participatory co-design to digitally mediated care. I often met people in their everyday environments and brought a sense of critical hope into the design of personal health records‚Äîencouraging patients to express their experiences in ways that felt natural and meaningful to them.
	<p>In one co-design project exploring personal health records and agency, we discovered that even technologies carry personas. These tools revealed themselves not as neutral or mundane interfaces, but as expressive, symbolic beings‚Äîlike butterflies, bats, dogs, and altars. These metaphors surfaced the emotional and cultural dimensions of care technologies, and they continue to shape how I design lanterns, workshops, and interactive experiences today.
	<p>As a <b>hard-of-hearing, neurodivergent artist-scientist and access designer</b>, I often rely on <b>non-verbal, visual-spatial modes of reflection</b>. My practice embraces alternative forms of communication‚Äîthrough light, movement, texture, and metaphor‚Äîto create spaces where data, care, and creativity can coexist. Whether in a clinical setting or a public art installation, I see each project as a dialogue: between systems and stories, between structure and softness.   
    </section>
	  
   <section id="mission-driven">
      	<h2>Let‚Äôs Collaborate to Build Access and Meaning</h2>
	<p>I welcome commissions, storefront activations, and cross-sector collaborations at the intersection of art, accessibility, and community care. With a background in healthcare and inclusive design, I bring a systems-informed approach to lantern-based artmaking that is adaptable, participatory, and environmentally responsive.
	<p>I invite partners across cultural, civic, and access-related sectors to help shape multisensory public experiences that are both artistically resonant and socially meaningful.

      <h2>‚ú® Easy Read Bio</h2>
      <p>Hello! I‚Äôm Ann. I‚Äôm a Deaf and neurodivergent artist based in Victoria and Vancouver, BC.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I make lanterns out of fabric, paper, light, vines, and plastic.</li>
        <li>I paint with black ink on translucent surfaces (called sumi-e).</li>
        <li>I build puppets and small stages using boxes and recycled materials.</li>
        <li>I perform without speaking‚Äîusing movement, light, and shadow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My art welcomes everyone. You do not need to hear or speak to enjoy it. I love to co-create projects that are fun, gentle, and accessible for all.</p>
